## Description

- The purpose of this week's challenge was to create a backend database using MongoDB and Mongoose by scratch. Similar to projects where I used Sequelize, I had to create models and api routes by scratch. This project using MongoDB and Mongoose to create a database had its challenges but I felt that I was able to pick this up rather quicker than Sequelize. Another requirement for this project was to ensure my database was seeded with data I created and as well as test all routes for proper functionality.
